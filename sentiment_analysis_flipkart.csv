5,Terrific,This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything...The performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps...The battery life is good. Not as good as most android phones but the efficiency of this processor is really good. You will have to buy a charger for 1800 rupees and that is a genuine inconvenience. Even though it charges at a good rate when charged using my mac mini usb c port...The camera is awesome. It takes some awesome photos and the video is just pure wizardry. It drains battery pretty fast while recording 4k videos which is expected due to the heavy processing and HDR it is doing. 30 fps videos can be shot at dolby vision HDR...The display doing 60hz is fine. It's very bright and sharp. You will get used to the notch in no time. 120hz would've been appreciated though. Speakers too are awesome. Stereo speakers make it very enjoyable. The haptics is next level and i am very happy with it.,iPhone 12,30999,MGJ83HN/A,0.9974,positive,positive,0.4298875661375661,positive

I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn‚Äôt waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black. Attached pics for the reference...1.OLED Screen is good but by default its much of a warmer tone.You can disable the True tone option.Dark mode is lit üî•üî•.2.Battery üîã lasts a day with Wifi ,location and Mobile Data on. Got 10 hour plus screen on time. Turn off Background App Refresh and turn off unnecessary location access..3. Performance is awesome with this 6 core 5 nano meter processor but yes we may see the device get hot while charging via 20watt charger.Don‚Äôt worry just unplug when device get warm and charge again when it cools down in a minute..4. Camera is awesome with vivid mode On. Night mode on front and back will surely make you say ‚Äòmmm Wow‚Äô.

5,Brilliant,"I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons..Pro:.1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation..2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates..3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email..4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone..Cons:.1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow..2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well..3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find..4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes..Update after 1 month:.1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging..2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure..3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone..Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.9955,positive,positive,0.11353281853281856,positive

5,Must buy!,"I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. ü§ó I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! ü•∞ Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE!

4,Value-for-money,"Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price..Pros:-..Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with...Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates..Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone..Cons:-..Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me...Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.0108,positive,positive,0.17794261294261296,positive
5,Highly recommended,I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied.

The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues.

5,Excellent,"What you'll like:.- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!.- 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics..- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight..- Slick haptics.- Battery lasts an entire day.- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS..- Superb value if bought during the sale...What you may not:.- It's a portable hand warmer. 8).- Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery..- Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!).- SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM.- Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full.

4,Nice product,"Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone).The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples..The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures..The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem..AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better..So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight....HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day..The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable..The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest...I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either...All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy.

4,Really Nice,"I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone.

5,Fabulous!,"An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years...I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up...Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly.

5,Awesome,"Great Camera, Great Specs, I'm Switched IPHONE XR to PIXEL 8. Pixel Experience is Brilliant. Worth Buying. Yes, Price is Kind of Higher than other phone. But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this.

5,Perfect product!,I'm not sure why there is so much negative talk about the product outside or even in Flipkart reviews about heating.My device didn't heat up much yes there is a slight warmth in extensive usage that I observed in the iPhone too..Secondly I liked the pixel because of the AI dude this is way smatter than iPhone in most of the aspects..Finally it's up to you to make a decision.If you want a smarter phone way smatter than apple then pixel is best..7 years of software updates and security patch that's insane,Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.6767,positive,positive,-0.04629629629629631,negative

Haptic and vibration is so good ...AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones...Cons:.Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option...Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight...Others: no applock inbuilt.

Picture quality is also near natural.- Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer..- Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot..- Battery is decent..Cons.- As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once..- Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times...Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.2987,positive,positive,0.13409297052154193,positive

5,Highly recommended,"Google has an overall winner with pixel 8..I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone..If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell...Pros:.1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere..2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department..3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use..4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!.5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range..6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight..7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much...Cons:.1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations..2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions..3. Speakers could have been better..4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing..5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that...Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.9981,positive,positive,0.2647397891963109,positive
5,Wonderful,"I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series...The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7...Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k.

5,Worth every penny,"The phone is absolute excellent!.Software experience is too good..Most importantly one has to understand certain things before buying this phone..1) tensor g3 vs SD processor :This phone is using a processor which is there in pix 8 pro too so trust the brand as updates will keep on optimising its functioning. Moreover I played certain games and it went well smooth..2) the phone has a lot of excellent features if one knows how to use he can get the best out of it..3) camera is about quality, what you see that you take. In other phones saturation etc are made to make pics attractive but that makes it compromising on quality. It goes into the finer details especially with those macro lens...A few cons is that the edges are smooth and comfortable so making it slight slippery to hold even with spigen cover, if you keep doing photography out in the sun it gets warm.

1,Don't waste your money. WORTHLESS!,"I bought this device with high expectations, but it turned out to be a nightmare. The device started heating up even when it was not in use, and I faced numerous issues within the first week of purchase. It only has two basic apps installed, yet it lags and heats up a lot...The network on this device is a mystery, as I get better network speed on any other 5G-enabled mobile with the same SIM card and at the same location. The camera is also not up to mark as the AI features are not smooth as advertised. The ad is misleading in this regard, as it requires a good connection to upload images before the device can use those AI features...Moreover, the device's screen has become unresponsive twice, and the camera is laggy. When I tried to use the hotspot on my laptop, it was not visible on any device, and the USB tethering option did not work either...The device is updated and has the latest Android security update and Android version installed. However, Google's support is useless, as they asked me to drop the device at a service center, which takes up to 15 working days, leaving me without any option but to buy a new mobile to use during this period...Apple's services are better than Google's, and I regret spending so much money on this device.

While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size...Coming back to my experience...Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous...Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast...Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls...I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase...Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it.

4,Worth the price,"EDIT: Review after 17 months usage.There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user..Cons:.1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day..2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive..3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition...Pros.1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny..2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23..3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones..4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time..5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam..6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now...At current market price S23 is highly recommended.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.9931,positive,positive,0.34591815591815595,positive

4,Value-for-money,I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone...Probs.1) excellent design..2) light weight pocket frendly device..3) good camera.4) performance is really excellent...Cons-.1) videography in night not gets good results..2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance..Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.....Average point.1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup..If you use power üîã saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down).....Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter..This was a review from my side.

5,Brilliant,"I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy.

Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed...The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging...Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone.

4,Good choice,"After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming..One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.8225,positive,positive,0.1172979797979798,positive

5,Simply awesome,Pros.1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera..2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth..3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated..4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+..5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb..6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.9954,positive,positive,0.13957317073170733,positive

4,Nice product,"Unbeatable device....Just one gripe with charging speed, or maybe I have come from Realme club where average charging speeds are 67 Watts compared to 30 Watts on S23. I feel charging speeds should be increased...Cameras are also great, cannot be compared with low light shots of Galaxy Note 23 but good enough for the price.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.705,positive,positive,0.2916666666666667,positive
4,Delightful,I got this phone 2 months back. Very light weight and decently good performing phone. The green color doesn't look as premium as other color. It's just an unconventional color. Very slippery body so better to use a back cover or case. Tempered glass should be used as I have already got few hairline scratches as I didn't use one. Apart from this the camera is not that extraordinary to beat its competitor iPhone. At this price it's expected to provide every feature that would beat the competitors. I don't understand why a charger is not in the kit as if it costs 10k. Processor is good but overall green s23 doesn't worth the price.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.5059,positive,positive,0.16188888888888886,positive
4,Good choice,Review after 1 week...Great camera.Performance is top notch..Phone does heat up while playing game...There are still bugs e.g. message app bottom flicker a lot where it says reply/know more..Sometime apps go unresponsive...Battery is biggest drawback.I am getting 4-4.5 hours screen on time from 85% to 10% and to add on that charging is slow.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.3818,positive,positive,0.09999999999999998,positive
